# LexiMatrix
LexiMatrix is a Web-based project that takes a word as input and maps it onto a 5xlength matrix.

## Introduction
For our 9th School musical, my teacher challenged me to create a programm capable of translating a list of words into a 5x13 matrix. The main objective is to generate a PDF cataloging all pixel/student positions. Within each block, we'll note whether the students should cross their arms for a particular word. As a result, each student receives their personalized section of the PDF, detailing exactly when to strike the arm-crossing pose.
